## Power Hour Spotify Player

Connects to Spotify, changes the song every minute, 
and keeps track of time and alcohol consumption.

Done in 90 mintutes on a Friday, so all spaghetti code.
A lot of code was taken from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_countdown
and https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/

PRs welcome
